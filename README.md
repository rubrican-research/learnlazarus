# Learn Lazarus
This repository contains a Lazarus/Free Pascal application that I will develop incrementally to demonstrate the capabilities of the Lazarus IDE.

I will  build the application from scratch in small increments - episodes. I shall create a YouTube Video to explain the steps and create a release that freezes the code that corresponds to the end of the episode. 

You can always go back and look at different versions to see how things were built.
